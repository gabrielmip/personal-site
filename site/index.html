			Hi! My name is <strong>Gabriel Pedrosa</strong>.
		</div>
		<div id="main">
			<p>I currently work as a Full Stack developer at <a href="https://www.waycarbon.com">WayCarbon</a>.
				Besides implementing new features, I also enjoy finding ways to improve the team's productivity,
				such as finding new/better tools or eliminating unnecessary complexity on the stack or code.</p>
			<p>Previously, I worked as a research assistant on a short-text retrieval project.
				We published two papers on topic modeling for short text.</p>
			<p>My hobbies come and go (except for music, I am always searching for new stuff).
				Currently, I play table tennis, go rock climbing and go nuts about privacy on the web (so much fun).
				In the past, I used to play basketball a lot, enjoyed ultimate frisbee, hiking, digital photography
				and real-time strategy games.</p>
